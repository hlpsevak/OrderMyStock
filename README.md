Project name: Order My Stock

This android application was created for my final year's academic project.

This application is made to streamline the process of ordering products from company to retailer.
The application allows any company and retailer to register themselves on the platform.
The registered company then can upload their products, delete products, accept orders from each retailer registered on the platform.
Retailers after registering can order products from any company listed in the application, can cancel order or if the products need to be 
replaced then it can apply for replacement.
Then company will approve or reject that replacement on the basis of reason for replacement.
